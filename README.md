# Content_based_image_search
utilised the combined strength of Faiss, Sentence Transformers, and Instruct Blip. Integrated Sentence Transformers turned textual searches into contextually aware, highly informative embeddings. a high-performance similarity search library called Faiss was used. To rapidly search through the enormous library of picture embeddings produced by Instruct Blip and Sentence Transformers, I painstakingly set up Faiss. As a result, our system was able to quickly recognise and find photos that nearly matched the textual queries. A ground-breaking technology that enables users to do image searches using only words is the end result of this research. Just by stating their search criteria, users can start searches for a variety of photographs.
